#Project II

This module introduces fundamental distributed version control systems and basic communication skills, including presentation skills.   The student will practice these skills through building an artifact based on multiple concurrent strands/modules in their programme. This module will act as an opportunity for the student to contextualise and link cross-strand concepts.
