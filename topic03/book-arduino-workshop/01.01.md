##Arduino

Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. In this lab, you will perform a few basic experments using the Arduino. You will learn how to:

- Connect an Arduino to your laptop
- Create an electronic circuit using standard components
- Write code that runs on the arduino and interacts with electronic components

##Arduino IDE

You will need to go [here](http://www.arduino.org/downloads)  and download the correct Arduino IDE for your particular OS.

##SEMS/WIT workshop
Once you have the IDE installed, go [here](http://witcomputingcamp.github.io/IoT/topic01/index.html) and try the experiments. You can use the Arduino kits provided in the lab to do this.
