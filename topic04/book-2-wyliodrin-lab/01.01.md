## Windows
- Insert the SD card into your SD card reader and check what drive letter it was assigned. You can easily see the drive letter (for example E:) by looking in the left column of Windows Explorer. You can use the SD Card slot (if you have one) or a cheap Adapter in a USB slot.
- Download the [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager) utility (it is also a zip file).
- Extract the executable from the zip file and run the Win32DiskImager utility; you may need to run the utility as Administrator! Right-click on the file, and select 'Run as Administrator'
- Select the unzipped Wyliodrin SD Card Image and rename it to iot-devkit-latest-mmcblkp0.direct.img.

- Click Write and wait for the write to complete.
- Exit the imager and eject the SD card.
