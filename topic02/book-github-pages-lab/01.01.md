###Web Pages

One way to help publicise your work is to create a web page that expresses your project concept to the wider internet community. Whereas a *readme.md* file in your project will give a brief technical overview of your project,  a web site can provide a more expressive and comprehinsive descrition of work, including any supporting resources such as training/instuctional videos and documentation. 

Some good examples of project websites can be found at the following links:
